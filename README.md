# Hello-World
Looks like I created this 4 years ago and now I'm back trying to teach myself some new things.
I'm starting with GitHub to learn code management and I'm going to try to build and deply my first app from a tutorial that I found on Amazon AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/ an Introduction: Build a Full-Stack React Application.
